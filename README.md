Showcases completion of CodSoft Web Development Internship tasks: Landing Page, Portfolio, Calculator. Enhancing HTML, CSS, JS skills.

This repository showcases my successful completion of the web development internship at CodSoft, where I undertook and completed three essential tasks aimed at enhancing my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

Task 1: Landing Page
For the first task, I designed and developed a captivating landing page. This project served as an excellent introduction to web development fundamentals, requiring meticulous attention to detail in HTML and CSS. I honed my skills in creating structured layouts, managing elements' alignments, and ensuring a visually appealing design. Through this task, I explored various design principles and learned to harmonize color palettes, typography, and spacing to craft an engaging user experience.

Task 2: Portfolio
The second task involved crafting a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS. This project allowed me to demonstrate my proficiency in creating dynamic and informative web pages. I meticulously designed the header section with my name and tagline, incorporated an about section with a brief bio and image, showcased my skills and projects, and provided a seamless user experience with a contact section and footer. This task not only showcased my technical skills but also emphasized the importance of presenting oneself professionally online.

Task 3: Calculator
The final task challenged me to develop a functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project delved deeper into JavaScript functionalities, requiring me to implement interactive features such as buttons for arithmetic operations, a display screen for user input and results, and logic for handling user interactions. By utilizing event listeners, conditional statements, and loops, I created an intuitive calculator that demonstrates my ability to apply JavaScript for practical applications.

Through these tasks, I have not only expanded my technical skills but also gained invaluable experience in problem-solving, project management, and collaboration. This repository serves as a testament to my dedication and growth as a web developer during my internship at CodSoft.
